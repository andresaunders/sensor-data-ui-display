## Future Directions

For future work, I would add more tests, and also more comprehensive input validation. 

For UI experience, I would include further styling to align with an appropriate style design

I would change direction input from being a text input to a dropdown menu, which would eliminate the need for input validation for the locaiton direction

I would implement pagination for vieweing sensor data in fixed window sizes instead of scrolling through all of the data.

I woudld icons for the buttons instead of text to be more user friendly

I would improve the editing workflow to be more intuitive

I would comment each function to ensure anyone reading the code understood the decisions made
